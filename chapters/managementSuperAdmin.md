# Super Admin management
## Add super admin
The *Add super admin* button in the menu allows you to invite a super admin to MaaS.
As illustrated in figure below, you will be asked to enter an e-mail (1), and click on the *Send invitation* button (4). When this operation has been completed, the super admin is redirected to the Show companies page.
